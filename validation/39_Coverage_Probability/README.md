# Validation Case 39: Coverage Probability of Confidence Intervals

This validation case tests the coverage probability of the confidence intervals generated by the standard method versus the block bootstrap method under varying levels of autocorrelation.

## Simulation Setup
- **Data Generation**: AR(1) errors + Linear Trend
- **True Slope**: 0.1
- **Sample Size (N)**: 50
- **Simulations**: 100
- **Target Confidence Level**: 0.95 ($\alpha=0.05$)

## Results
The table below shows the proportion of simulations where the calculated confidence interval contained the true slope value (Coverage Probability).

|   Rho (Autocorrelation) | Standard Coverage   | Bootstrap Coverage   |   Avg Width (Std) |   Avg Width (Boot) |
|------------------------:|:--------------------|:---------------------|------------------:|-------------------:|
|                     0   | 89.0%               | 94.0%                |            0.0412 |             0.0474 |
|                     0.5 | 77.0%               | 94.0%                |            0.0465 |             0.0821 |
|                     0.8 | 54.0%               | 87.0%                |            0.061  |             0.1581 |

## Interpretation
- **Ideal Outcome**: Coverage should be close to 95%.
- **Standard Method**: With high autocorrelation (rho > 0), the standard method typically produces intervals that are too narrow, leading to coverage significantly below 95%.
- **Bootstrap Method**: The block bootstrap method should account for the autocorrelation, producing wider intervals that maintain coverage closer to the nominal 95% level.
