### Example 14: Time Vector Nuances (Numeric Data) ###

This example highlights a crucial detail when working with numeric
time vectors (as opposed to datetimes): the units of the Sen's slope
are determined by the units of the time vector `t`.

Using a simple integer sequence vs. a more meaningful time representation
(like fractional years) does NOT change the significance of the trend,
but it is critical for interpreting the slope's magnitude.
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Generated Data ---
Generated 10 years of annual data with an increasing trend.
Years: [2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019]
Values: [ 9.64 10.94 11.92 12.23 12.61 12.31 13.73 13.45 14.04 14.2 ]
------------------------------------------------------------

--- 3. Analysis with `t = [0, 1, 2, ...]` ---
First, we use a simple integer sequence as the time vector. This is
common but means the resulting slope is in 'units per index step'.

Integer Time Vector Results:
Slope: 0.4182 (units per index)
P-value: 0.0003
S-statistic: 41.0

This slope is numerically correct, but not easily interpretable.
------------------------------------------------------------

--- 4. Analysis with `t = [2010, 2011, ...]` ---
Now, we use the actual years as the time vector. This makes the
resulting slope directly interpretable as 'units per year'.

Year Time Vector Results:
Slope: 0.4182 (units per year)
P-value: 0.0003
S-statistic: 41.0

This slope has a clear, real-world meaning.
------------------------------------------------------------

--- 5. Conclusion ---
The P-value and S-statistic are IDENTICAL in both tests. The choice
of time vector does not affect the trend's significance, only the
magnitude and interpretability of the Sen's slope.

Recommendation: Always use a time vector with meaningful units
(e.g., years, fractional years) when possible.
