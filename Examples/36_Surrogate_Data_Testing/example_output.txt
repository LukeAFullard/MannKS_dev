Running Example 36: Surrogate Data Hypothesis Testing

--- Scenario 1: Evenly Spaced Red Noise (No Trend) ---
Standard MK Test:
  Trend: decreasing
  P-value: 0.2516 (Likely < 0.05, a Type I Error)

Running Surrogate Test (IAAFT)...
Surrogate Test Result:
  Method Used: iaaft
  Surrogate P-value: 0.6760
  Is Trend Significant? False
  (A high p-value correctly indicates the 'trend' is just noise.)

--- Scenario 2: Unevenly Spaced Data with Trend ---
Data points: 63 (irregularly spaced)
Running Surrogate Test (Lomb-Scargle)...
Surrogate Test Result:
  Method Used: lomb_scargle
  Surrogate P-value: 0.0000
  Is Trend Significant? True
  (Low p-value correctly identifies the trend despite red noise + gaps.)
