### Example 13: Comparing Confidence Interval Methods ###

This example compares the two methods for calculating the confidence
intervals (CI) for the Sen's slope: 'direct' (default) and 'lwp'.
The choice of method affects how the confidence limits are selected
from the distribution of all pairwise slopes.

--- Generated Data ---
Generated a simple linear dataset with some noise.
Data head:
        date     value
0 2010-01-01  2.180566
1 2011-01-01  4.884815
2 2012-01-01  4.996199
3 2013-01-01  6.273648
4 2014-01-01  8.728401
------------------------------------------------------------

--- 3. Analysis with `ci_method='direct'` (Default) ---
The 'direct' method calculates the ranks of the upper and lower CIs
and rounds them to the nearest integer to directly index the sorted
array of pairwise slopes. It is fast and straightforward.

Direct CI Results:
Annual Slope: 0.7743
Annual CI: (0.5126, 1.1186)

--- 4. Analysis with `ci_method='lwp'` ---
The 'lwp' method emulates the LWP-TRENDS R script. It uses linear
interpolation between the two slopes on either side of the calculated
rank. This can provide a more precise, non-integer estimate for the
confidence limits, but the difference is often small.

LWP CI Results:
Annual Slope: 0.7743
Annual CI: (0.5088, 1.1228)

Conclusion: As shown, the Sen's slope is identical, but the confidence
intervals are slightly different due to the calculation method.
