This task added extensive validation sweeps (V-33 and V-34) covering non-seasonal and seasonal trends with mixed censoring. It confirmed that the LWP R script's 'NonSeasonalTrendAnalysis' function deletes the 'TrendCategory' column, necessitating a direct call to 'AssignConfCat' in validation wrappers. The validations confirm high alignment between MannKS and the LWP R script for censored data.
