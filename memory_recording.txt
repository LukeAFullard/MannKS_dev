This task verified the trend classification logic between MannKS and LWP R script using a sensitivity sweep (V-32). Key finding: The LWP R script function 'NonSeasonalTrendAnalysis' deletes the 'TrendCategory' column from its output, requiring the R wrapper to explicitly call 'AssignConfCat' to retrieve the classification label. The statistical engine (p-values, confidence) matches perfectly.
